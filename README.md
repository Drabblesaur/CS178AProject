# CS178AProject

First idea is, updating the school map, besides updating the school map manually, but also need to add new futures. For example, If a student is at lot 30, they are looking for their class at Boyce Hall, probably can build an app that guides the student from lot 30 to Boyce Hall. (Need Professors approval, If haven't heard back from Tuesday, give up)

Seocnd idea is, testing center scheduling system. ( On canvas) 


Proposal: UCR Map Project

Team members: Brian Porter, Nick Lin, Jasmine Ojeda, Justin Chen, Johnny To

Final Vision: A mobile/web application that can be used to easily navigate the UCR campus.

Create a mobile/web application that allows people to navigate the UCR campus with ease. The current UCR map is difficult to navigate and unclear with its layout. The building names are vague and can be misleading, for example "Chass North" and "Chass South" or "Chung Hall" instead of "Winston Chung Hall", which a student who has never navigated on UCR before may get confused by. Then, even if students find the building their classes are in, they can still spend a lot of time looking for their classroom, sometimes going around the building multiple times. The improved UCR Map app we will create provides further details to help navigate to not only classes and buildings, but other locations in UCR that students may want to visit, such as the Botanic Gardens or the Orbach Library.
