# CS178AProject

First idea is, updating the school map, besides updating the school map manually, but also need to add new futures. For example, If a student is at lot 30, they are looking for their class at Boyce Hall, probably can build an app that guides the student from lot 30 to Boyce Hall. ( Need Professors approval)

Seocnd idea is, testing center scheduling system. ( On canvas)
