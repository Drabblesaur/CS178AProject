## Description

Final Vision: A mobile/web application that can be used to easily navigate the UCR campus.

Create a mobile/web application that allows people to navigate the UCR campus with ease. The current UCR map is difficult to navigate and unclear with its layout. The building names are vague and can be misleading, for example "Chass North" and "Chass South" or "Chung Hall" instead of "Winston Chung Hall", which a student who has never navigated on UCR before may get confused by. Then, even if students find the building their classes are in, they can still spend a lot of time looking for their classroom, sometimes going around the building multiple times. The improved UCR Map app we will create provides further details to help navigate to not only classes and buildings, but other locations in UCR that students may want to visit, such as the Botanic Gardens or the Orbach Library.
